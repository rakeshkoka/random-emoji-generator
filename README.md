# Random Emoji Generator

This project generates a random emoji with its name on button click using the Emoji API. The emojis are fetched from the API and displayed interactively. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript to handle asynchronous data fetching and DOM manipulation, making it fun and educational for beginners.


## Features

- Fetches a set of random emojis using the Emoji API.
- Displays a random emoji and its name when a button is clicked.
- Uses async/await for handling API requests.
- Simple and responsive UI with HTML and CSS.


## How It Works
    1. The app fetches emoji data from the [Emoji API](https://emoji-api.com/) on page load.
    2. A button is provided, and on each click, a random emoji from   the fetched list is displayed along with its name.
    3. The emoji's name is formatted to remove the first few characters (e.g., removing prefixes from names like "face with tears of joy").
## Project Structure
- HTML: Basic structure for the button and display area for the emoji and its name.
- CSS: Styling for the button and emoji display.
- JavaScript: Handles fetching emoji data from the API and displaying it on the webpage.
## Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the content.
- CSS: For styling the page.
- JavaScript: For dynamic functionality and API integration.
- Emoji API: Used for fetching the emoji data.
